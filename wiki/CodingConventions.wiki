#summary Coding conventions for the library

==Calling Conventions==

Functions organize their parameters in the following order:

  * OUT parameters
  * IN parameters
  * `pc_pool_t` parameter(s)


==Function Conventions==

Each "object" in PoCore (typically) has the following functions:

`pc_type_create(*ob, ..., pool)`
 Create the object, allocated from `pool`, returning the result in `ob`.

`pc_type_destroy(ob)`
 Destroy `ob`. This will close external resources, but associated memory will remain allocated until the pool is destroyed.

`pc_type_track(ob, ctx)`
 Begin tracking `ob` within the tracking system managed by `ctx`.

`pc_type_track_via(ob, pool)`
 Begin tracking `ob` within the tracking system managed by the context implied by `pool`

`pc_type_owns(ob, pool)`
 Record that `ob` is an owner of `pool`. Tracking will be started for `ob` and `pool` if they are not already subject to tracking.
